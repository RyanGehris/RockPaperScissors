The second function prompts the player to type in rock, paper, or scissors

The third function takes two parameters, the computers selection and the players selection, and utilizes and if and else if statments to return whether the player tied, won, or lost to the computer.

The final function is five rounds of rock paper scissors where the score is kept and a winner is proclaimed
